The trillo app. 

How does the app look like? Well there is a pink background (which is the body element). 
And in the center we have a container that is centered on the viewport. 
We next have a header on the top of the container. Next we have a black side bar and on the right 
we have a hotel overview. 

We will start with the overall container. We make a div with a class of container. The container will host the 
header and the content. The header will be the top white strip. The container will have two children. The
first child will be the side bar. We give the side bar a navigation tag. This is because it is a navigation. The other is 
the main content, so we give a html tag of main.

We now go to the layout.scss file to fix the layout. Notice how we came to the layout scss. We identified the 
major sections. 

We start with the container. We make it such that it occupies 120rem as the maximum witdh. We center it with 8rem auto for
margin property. and we give it a background color of grey. Next we add a box shadow. Note that we added a min-height of 
50rem. This is for testing purposes otherwise it look weird. We also defined the box shadow in the css properties.

We gave the header a height of 7rem and gave it some color. I think the border bottom is not correct however.


Now we want to put flexbox in action. We put display of flex on the content class. The navigation should have a witdh
so we need to use the flex basis property on the sidebar class.

	flex: 0 0 18%;

means no grow or shrink but the witdh of the element is 18% of the parent. However, the hotel view is not optimised. 
That is it should occupy the remaining. so it must grow. Simply we say 
	flex: 1 
on the hotel view class.
