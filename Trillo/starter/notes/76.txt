We want the images and the svgs in the header tag to be align horizontally. So our flex container must be header element.
The flex items are going to be the direct children under the header which are logo, search, user-nav. We give some color
to the seach and user-nav of background color of red and green. Finally we use the justify-content: space-between to 
spread the flex items on the main-axis. We also use the align-items center to center the items on the cross-axis.
Next we just fix the individual elments by fixing up the margins.

For the search bar we put a propety of flex because it is one item. We set the flex: 0 0 40%. Which basically tells that
it should not shrink, grow but be 40% of the parent element.

Note that the input form need to have a property of inherit for font family and size because that is not the default. We
added a pseudoclass for the focus element. We also make the search bar 90% of the parent element and make it larger when
we focus on it. 

We put a margin of -3.5rem on the search button because it is a quick and easy way to make the image move when we click.

Now we want to center it. So we need to make the search class become a flex container. We make the align-items and justify
-content to center as both. 

We use the following code to change the background color of the button when we focus on the search bar. The ajacent selector
is required.

&__input:focus + &__button {
		background-color: var(--color-grey-light-3);
	}

We change the color of the SVG using the fill property and we give a dark color.

We change the color of the placeholder and use the website.
