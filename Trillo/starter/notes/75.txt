In the header we have three important parts. The logo on the left handside, the search bar and the button icon, and finally
the navigation bar on the right handside.

The logo is made using the following well known html 
<img src="img/logo.png" alt="trillo logo" class="logo">

Now for the search bar we use the following html. We know that it needs to be a form tag with an input tag. The form
will be submiteed but for now we put no action.

<form action="#" class="search">
    				<input type="text" class="search__input" placeholder="Search hotels">
    				<button class="search__button">
    					<svg class="search__icon">
    						<use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-magnifying-glass"></use>
    					</svg>
    				</button>
    			</form>

We use SVG because sometimes text icons may fail to load sometimes and it will look like a black box. There
is also another issue with screen reader.

We go to icomoon and get the svgs that we want. Note that we untick png because we dont want that. From all the files
we need the spritefile and the SVG folder. This file contains all the 10svg that I clicked and downloaded.
This is better because we only need to make one http request. 
We put the sprite file and the svg folder in the imgs folder.

To use the svg. You need a svg tag with a inner element of use and a attribute of xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#nameofsvg"
to use the svg. You can get the name of the svg from the demo file.

This is the best way to use a svg becauses this way we can change the color of the svg using css.

But you will only be able to see this on a webserver. note that it is easier to position items withsvg than text.

now you make the nav element on the right handside. inside the nav element we will have 3 divs. Two of them will be
icons and the other will be a picture of the user. The icons will use svg and a span to bring attention to the pending
number of stuff to alert.

    			<nav class="user-nav">
    				<div class="user-nav__icon-box">
    					<svg class="user-nav__icon">
    						<use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-bookmark"></use>
    					</svg>
    					<span class="user-nav__notification">7</span>
    				</div>

    				<div class="user-nav__icon-box">
    					<svg class="user-nav__icon">
    						<use xlink:href="img/sprite.svg#icon-chat"></use>
    					</svg>
    					<span class="user-nav__notification">13</span>
    				</div>

    				<div class="user-nav__user">
    					<img src="img/user.jpg" alt="User photo" class="user-nav__user-photo">
    					<span class="user-nav__user-name">Jonas</span>
    				</div>
    			</nav>

We need to style the svg. Inorder to do that we will use the compoents scss partial file to it happen. But know that
this is not the best way to do this. It may be better to have a better way of arranging this, maybe a different file.

to size a svg you just set the height and the witdh. For example the search will be 

.search {
	&__input {

	}

	&__button {

	}

	&__icon {
		height: 2rem;
		width: 2rem;
	}

}
