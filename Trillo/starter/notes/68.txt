intro to flexbox. 

It is a new module in CSS3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another in different directions and orders

The main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ablility to expand and shrink elements to best use all the 
available space.

Flexbox is good for one dimensional layouts. x or y.

To use flex you need to set the div to display of flex. This will make a flex container. The stuff inside the flex
container is called the flex items. The length along the line that the flex items are aligned is called the main axis.
The perpendicular axis is called the cross axis.

The properties on the flex container.
------------------
flex-direction: row| row-reverse| column| column-reverse (the direction of the flex container)
flex-wrap: nowrap| wrap| wrap-reverse (tells you if it wraps if there is not enough space)
justify-content: flex-start| flex-end| center| space-between| space-around| space-evenly ( tell you how the flex items will
be aligned along the main axis)
align-items: stretch| flex-start| flex-end| center| baseline (this tells how the flex items will be align in the 
cross axis)
align-content: stretch| flex-start| flex-end| center| baseline| space-between| space-around ( tell how the rows are aligned
in the cross axis if there is some space

The properties on the flex items.
------------------
align-self: auto| stretch| flex-start| flex-end| center| baseline (tells how the indivual item will align)
order: 0 |<integer> (tell you how the items should appear)
flex-grow: 0 (tells you how much an item can grow)
flex-shrink: 0 (tells you how much it can shrink)
flex-basis: auto (tells you the base width of the flex item).
The three properties can be defined as flex: 0 1 auto for example where 0 is flex-grow,flex-shrink and flex-basis respectively
