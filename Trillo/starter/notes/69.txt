To use flexbox set the display property to flex. This will cause the flex items to which are the children elements on the
container class to side by side. 

Note that this property was applied on the parent. We can only apply more flexbox properties on the parent. 
The flex-direction: row-reverse will cause the flex items to start from the right. The main axis is now position from
right to left. There is column which is the main axis going from top to bottom. The reverse is from bottom to top.

justify-content: center applied on the parent element will center all the children elements. justify-content: space-between
will cause the space between elements to have the same spacing (note that it is responsive and will adjust as you make
the window smaller).justify-content: space-around make the space around the element the same. justify-content: space-evenly
make the space evenly along the row. 

align-items defines how the flex items are positioned in the cross axis. Inititally, the align-items is stretch, that means
that if there is a bigger element then all the items will have strech to ocupy the same height. if you set to center
then all the items will be centered around the biggest element as the center axis. If you set to flex start then all the
flex items will be positioned at the start. If you use baseline then it will be align on words. That is image the line
that is below all the words.

Note that the main and cross axis switch when we changet he flex-direction.
