Now we will look at the flex-items. If you want to align a specific element on the cross axis you use align-self 
on that element. That is align self is defined on the flex item class. 

If you want to play around with the order you specify the order. The default order on flex items is 0. 
If you set flex-grow they will grow to ocuppy as much space as they can while the other properties are true. Flex grow
is a relative value. flex-basis is the witdh and it % based on the witdh of the container. 

All items shrink when we make the browser smaller. If you dont want it to shrink you set the flex-shrink to 0 on that
class item.
