The hamburger sign was made in the tutorial. The three bars were made using one span element. The label tag is the white button. Inside the label tag we what a span element.
The span element has a class of navigation__icon. Since we need three items we can use the same span element and use the pseudoelements. We give the element a witdh of 3 rem and 
heigth of 2px and make the color of the background black. This give the illusion of a line. We give the navigation__icon a margin-top of 3.5rem to center it. We give the display for each a display of inline-block.
This is because we can center it with textalign propety if we used inline-block. Note that the display same display property is applied to all the pseudoelements. We use position abosulte to position 
the the before and after (rememeber that content:"" must be shown). We give a left of 0 and add the transitions. Then we position the before with top of -.08rem realtive to the parent element and after iwth 0.8rem.

&__button:hover &__icon::before {
		top: -1rem;
	}

	&__button:hover &__icon::after {
		top: 1rem;
	}

is usedto expand the bottom and top bar. 

Note that we made the curosor on the button property to pointer.

Now we try to make the X show up.
Since this happens when we clicks the white element we want to do the checkbox hackagain.

The selector is  &__checkbox:checked + &__button &__icon
This selector will select the brother of checkbox class of button and then select the icon class of the button.
Now we are going to hide it. The reason we hide it is because for a X we only need two lines. The two lines will be the before and after.

The __checkbox:checked + &__button &__icon::before  and __checkbox:checked + &__button &__icon::after are selected. The top is made 0 and 
the lines are rotated(45degs). The bottom is top 0 and the transform is rotated (-45).

Generally when the rotation happens it happens on the center. You can change this with rotate origin.
