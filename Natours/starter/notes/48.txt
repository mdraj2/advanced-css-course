Because we are using the BEM notation we want to give the element with class name of footer with a 
class of footer. We give a padding of 10 rem on the top and the bottom and 0 on the left and right. This is 
to get the background color of grey dark. We give a font size of 1.4rem and color of grey light. The color and 
font size will be inherited by the children.


We link the logo png image using the source tag and give it a class name of footer__logo. Note that
this class inside the div with class of footer__logo-box. The give the class of logo box with text-align of center and 
margin bottom of 8 rem. Note that the image is an inline elements behave like text so it can be centered with 
text-align. We give the log so size 15rem and the height is auto. The difference between height auto and height 100% is 
that height auto will be based on the height on the children. e.g 

<div style="height:50px">
    <div id="innerDiv" style="height:auto">
          <div id="evenInner" style="height:10px">
          </div>
    </div>
</div>

now the #innerDiv is going to have height:10px

In this case we are trying to maintain the aspect ratio of the image.

Next we need a row with two columns to house the additional links like company and contact us, careers and privacy policy
and another for the copywright stuff.

For the first column you have the navigation class and houses an unordered list of the following stuff like company
privacy policy. The unorder list is given a class of footer__list and the li tags given footer__items and the anchor
tags given footer__link. 

The navigation class is given a border top of 1px that looks white and we give some padding on the top to move 
the content in the navigation class downwards. This is so that there is some distance between them.

Next we give a display of inline-block. Remember that the rows populated with content will take up the entire
block. The is padding in all the columns except the last one. The white border on top will extend more than it is 
required so we will set it to inline block. Now the column's content size does not change but the size occupied 
the navigation is changed to minimise the amount as much as possible. This means the line stop after the last
content of "terms".

We give a the list items of style none to remove everything.

Naturally, the list items are block items. So then inorder to get them to stack next to each other we need to 
get them to become inline-block. And we give them space by specfying margin right of 1.5rem but dont apply to the 
last element. 

&:not(:last-child) {
	margin-right: 1.5rem;
}

We next make the links animate. All these links have the class of footer_link. We need to apply these to visted and 
link. All links will have a color of light grey and we remove the underlines by removing text-decorations. Make them 
upper case and display inline (not sure if we need to specfiy this twice, i think they are inline blocks ( the <a> tag).
When we hover and active them we give it a primary color and do some other effects.

finally we maek the copy right section. We give the same border and the the padding on top like the navigation
. But the difference is that we give 80% width and float it to the right. The problem is that content takes up the 
whole column div. So the idea is that we make it smaller width, the inside. This will make the white line less pronouned
and finally we float it to the right of the parent container. This is to get the illusion of symetry along the logo.


Next we make the white line on top of the contact us stuff
