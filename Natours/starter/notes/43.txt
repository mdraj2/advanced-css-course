Building the story picture blurrs and text shows again

Use figurecaption element to add more information to the figure element.

the shape class in the story scss was set to position equal to relative. We want to position the caption with respect to
the shape class. For the caption class position is absolute and set in the middle.

But the text will not be centered and for this we use the transform:translate property. When using the % for translate
we are taking into account the element itself. So -50,-50 will center the element usually after a position absolute.

We center the text in the element and increase the size. Also we make it not visible
at the begining by setting the opacity to 0.

Now we add a pseudoclass which will listen to hovering. We make the opacity of the 
text go from 0 to 1 on hovering. Note that by chaining the sectors such as 
&:hover &__caption, we say that when hover is true apply the following to the 
caption class.

transition was used to animate the effects. 

backface-visibility: hidden; was added to prevent pixel jumps
transform:translateX(-3rem) scale(1.0); was added to zoom out of the 
original picture. 
Animation was added to the caption as well as the img

Filters were added. The blur and brightness. just like the trasform 
they two filters were stacked in one line.

HTML for Mary was duplicated for Jack wilson. At the end a button for class
btn-text which was made earlier was added.&rarr; was used to make inline right arrow in html
