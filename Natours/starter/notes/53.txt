In this section we want to make the pop up close. We will use anchors. We can use id on different parts of our HTML tags.
For example we can set the id on <a> to nagivate to different ids on our page.

Coming back to our pop up. We cannot set it to display none,because if we do we wont be able to animate it.
So we want to make the opacity 0 and visibility:hidden. Note that these properties were added to the popup class.

We are going to use the target pseudoclass to make this work. We add the id of popup the div containing the class 
of popup. Pressing the booking button we target direct to the id of containing popup. 

Basically we say that if the popup class has been targeted we make the visbility to visible and the opacity to 1 to
show the content. But in general target is url based, if the url fragement matches the target then only will this work.

&:target {
		opacity: 1;
		visibility: visible;
	}

Lets say we want to close this. How will we do that? There will be another anchor tag that will take me to the 
section-tours(e.g telling the user to close the popup). We use the html (&times;) which is basically like an X.
When we press it the css properties on the pseudoclass will not apply (hence hidden). Since the X is text based 
we want to remove the default line height of 1.7 to 1. This will make it look better. And when we hover we want the
text to become green.

Now we want the white box to be small,invisible and then slowly become larger when we click the book now
button. We need to add a line of transform: translate(-50%,-50%) scale(.25); to the &__content because 
we can only have one transform property (the initial is from the mixin). 

Since the initial state of the white box is inisible we want to make it show when we click the target button
then the css is 
&:target &__content {
		opacity: 1;
		transform: translate(-50%,-50%) scale(1);
	}
