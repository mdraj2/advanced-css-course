we made a section to contain the form. There will be a lot of css involved in this project 
The form will be a reusable piece of component so make a scss file for that. So we want to 
extract things like the name email address and radio buttons into the scss file

we add padding to the section-book and add the background color skin. Why would we use padding 
is there a better way to do this??

We move up one level and add now make the book section. We added the URl and set to background size to cover.
Note that without any content the background image will not show. 
Next we added the shadow. Look at the documentation for the parameters. 

We are trying to achieve a slanted background with two different colors. So we use
the gradient method to achieve this. 

background-image: linear-gradient(60deg, rgba($color-white,0.9) 0%, rgba($color-white,0.9) 49.9%,transparent 50%),url(../img/nat-10.jpg);

we have two backgrounds.The linear gradient is on top
and color fades from white to transparent. We say that we want white from 0 to 50% and 
orange from 50% and greater

All of the styling was applied to the section-book so far

Next book__form was defined and contains all the form stuff. It has a witdh of 50%
and a padding of 6rem. 
This makes sense because we want to have content on the side of the total div containing book class


Next, we make a form element. there are three div tags nested and each has a class of form group
we use the for keyword to link an input. Note that label and input go together
