For desktop first we start with the largest media queries for the largest to the smallest.

The order of doing the media queries are Base + typography > general layout +grid > page layout > components

We font need to do alot of change because that will be taken care with the font size in the HTML element.

We need to apply media queries so to the typography. The design breaks at around 600px or at small screen size.
We will also want to remove the white border on small screen sizes. 

We add media query in the base scss file of the body and add a media query for padding 0 at tab port size.

For typography we go to the --main and change the letter-spacing and the font-size to 1 rem and 5 rem respectively
for the phone size. The typography was not scaling properly for the smaller screen. For the sub heading we reduce the 
letter spacing to 0.5 using a media queries targetted for the phones.

Now we are going to fix up the grid section. In mobile we want to transform all the rows into columns when we make
the screen small.
