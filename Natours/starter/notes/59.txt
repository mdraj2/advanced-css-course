We want to remove the hover on the tours card on mobile screen because hover does not work on mobile screen. We dont want
the value to sit on the back of the card. So we must bring it to the front.

We open up the card.scss file and modify it with media queries. In this section we will have a very big media quries
because we will basically have a big rewrite of the section. We copy the content in this file in the big media query and
refactor it.

In the media query the perspective and the position does not have to be changed. We will now change the height to auto
why? Because we want the back side and the front side to have the same size but that is not required in this case.
So we overwrite it and set it to auto. We change the side css selector from position absolute to relative.

The front part does not need any changing.
We remove most of the back part and change the rotateY to 0.

Alot of refactoring was done. It is important to note that 
if a div is empty it is likely that the inner content is set to position absolute.

The cards were fixed. The next section is the story section.

Now complete the home section.

Now complete the books section in the home.scss file

Note that background image 100% make the image go from the x = 0 to x = 100%.

You should try to fix the book now section by yourself.
