Flexbox completely changes the way that we build one dimensional layouts.

The element that we use flex on is called the flex container. To make a flex container we set the property to display
flex. If you use flex-line then it will be a flexbox that behavours like a inline element. The items inside the flex
container is called the flex items. There are two axis the main axis and the cross axis.
