What is the difference between. What is the difference of images in html and css? In html that means all the 
images in img tags. In css however, the images in css are when we use background images.

We will start with density switching. We will serve high resolution images for bigger screens and the opposite for 
low resolution screens

You can tell the browser to select the optimum image using the srcset attribute on img tags. This is different from the 
normal src attibute. The url followed by 1x , url 2x will tell the browser to choose the optimmum images. If the 
screen is low density then the 1x will be choosen,otherwise the 2x will be choosen.

Art direction is using a different images for different screen widths.For art direction we use the picture html tag.  
Inside the picture element we will have a source and img element. We need atleast one image or zero or more sources.
We copy the previous image tag and put it in the picture element. The source element will have a media tag. In the media
tag we can we a media query. We put max-width: 37.5em in the media attribute. This means the source tag will apply
when the max-width is smaller than 37.5em. In the source element with the the srcset and set the img locations
using 1x and 2x.
