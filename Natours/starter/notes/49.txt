Basically we want to make a navbar. The idea is we want to have a checkbox that will activate cause the green background show when the circle with the
hamburger is clicked. We hide the checkbox the same way we did with radio buttons. We give the class navigation__checkbox with a display of none. We 
attach the input tag containing type checkbox with the label tag of navigation__button. For now we insert the word "MENU" so that it shows up on the screen.
We give a background color of white and set the height and witdh of 7 rem. the border radius of 50% will cause the square to become a circle.
We give a position of fixed so that the circle will remain in the same position as we scroll. Next we position it with top of 6 rem and right 6 rem.
The right positioning attribute will cause it to show up on the right hand side of the page. The z index will cause the button to remain on page as we scroll 
downwards. 

We make a nagivation background and we put &nbsp;. I think we dont need to put but for the sake of nothing we put it. This div is the background and 
has a class of navigation__button. The background need to be a circled version of the white circle, but we want it to show underneath. So we give 
a z-index of 100. We next give it a height and witdh of 6rem a border radius of 50% and top and right of 6.5rem. We a background image of radial gradient.
Next we scale it by 80% to make it cover the entire screen. Note that we want this colored circle to be smaller than the white circle because we want it 
to animate when we scale it by 80%.

Now for the nav element. We give the nav element the 100vh for height and 100% for witdh. This will make the navigation tag cover the entire page. You give it a
position of fixed and position it at the top right. This will take the element out of normal document flow. We dont want the nav page to occupy scroll page. 

We give the list postion absolute. It will know that it is relative to the __nav class. and to center it we use the transform translate property and remove the
list style. We also center the text.

Between each item we give a margin of 1rem

For the link tags we display them as inline block. This is important because otherwise the css will not be applied the way we want and the transform properties
will not work on the list items. The list items default is display:list-item. We need to override that to inline block.

background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, transparent 0%, transparent 50%, $color-white 50%);
background-size: 250%;

Basically we make the background 250% bigger and then on hover we bring it back to middle which shows the white portion of the background
