We add the video to the background

We make an element that take up the witdh of the section

We use the video element to embed the video.

We dont use the src attribute instead we use the source element

We have two source elements and one is for mp4 and the other is for webm

We used coverr.co to get the background

If the videos cannot be played then the text I wrote "Your browser is not support will show"

We added options to the video. Two were autoplay and muted and loop.

We made a bg-video scss file incase we will have more than one video in the page.

We set the position of the video to absolute and position on the top left. We give the 
height and witdh of the parent container which is section stories.

We set the video element with a z-index of -1 and remove the grey background. Otherwise the 
video will not show

We want to make the background of the story element (e.g the container with the names) to become slighly lighter
So we use the background property. If we use opacity it will change make the word even transparent. We use
background-color: rgba($color-white,.6); on the story element and make it opacity equal to 60%.

Now we want to make the video fit into the section. That is the video must have the same dimension as the 
bg-video. But know this that aspect ratio must be maintained. This will not be true however. We need to use 
object fit. This will help maintain the aspect ratio while covering the entire parent element and the parts 
that do not fit will be clipped off. You would use cover as I did here, but other options such as fill could be used as 
well but the aspect ratio will not be maintained. Cover will fit from top to bottom and clip the extra. Overflow was added 
in case the the video overflows from the parent element
