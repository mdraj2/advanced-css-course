we will reduce the spacing between the footer logo and the text using media quries.

@include respond(tab-port) {
	margin-bottom: 4rem
	
}

Now the layout,base and typography is taken care of we begin making the About and Features Section. We will go to the
_home.scss page to fix the padding between the sections as there is too much when we shrink to mobile size. 

We add

@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 20rem 0;
	}

to the section-about 

and for the .section-features we add

@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 15rem 0;
	}

and for the .section-tours we add

@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 20rem 0 10rem 0;
	}

and for the .section-stories we add

@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 10rem 0;
	}
and for the .section-book we add

@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 10rem 0;
	}

We will also start adding media queries to utilties classes aswell. Look at utility class. We need to adjust the 
utility class because there is so much space inbetween.

Next we want to fix the composition and the feature box. The composition is 3 photos. We want to remove the position absolute
to postion relative and then float them to the left. We then make the width smaller (33.333% of the parent width) . This
is so that all the 3 photos will be in one line and we make the shadow less pronounced. These media queries are applied
to the __photo class. For the individual photos we add media queries to change the z-index and the position.

Next the feature box. We want to make the icon smaller and the padding smaller. We add the media queries. respectively

@include respond(tab-port) {
			margin-bottom: 0;
		}
@include respond(tab-port) {
		padding: 2rem;
	}
