We want to hide the background and the navigation so we dont want it to show up when we are opening the page.
I added some shadow on the box so use the box shadow property. 
We want to hide the navigation page. To do so we want set the witdh to 0 and set the opacity to 0. But this did not collapse the content properly.
MAybe there is another way to do it. I found out that opacity will make it none showable, but visiblity will turn off
the click events. So use both together. The opacity is used because it will be animated as the transition occurs and finally,
the element will be set to visibility of hidden. If you dont do this this until the animation is done 
the state of visibility will remove after the check box is clicked.

We learned about the cubic-benizie function that is just another way for defining the easing animation. 

I used the selector to change the opacity and the width of the nav to center the content
